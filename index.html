            the three semantic tags that must be on every page you create
            are header, main, and footer.

            Most semantic tags are containers. They need actual HTML elements inside them.
            Just putting text inside a footer without a p tag or h2 tag is not acceptable.
            The exception is figcaption

            (Just containers which means its bad pratice to not include some HTML element
            that goes inside the container.)

            All youre content IS ALWAYS IN THE BODY. It should NOT be anywhere else
